The purpose of this app was to explore ways of using Backbone and multiple API calls and multiple views

The app loads on the top 25 most popular items on etsy, when choosing an item the user is then taken to the detail view that presents the detial of the item and the sellers store.

ALOT of styling is still needed in refining the latter too... on my todo!
